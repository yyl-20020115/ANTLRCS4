 *  <p>This is a one way link.  It emanates from a state (usually via a list of
 *  transitions) and has a target state.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Since we never have to change the ATN transitions once we construct it,
 *  we can fix these transitions as specific classes. The DFA transitions
 *  on the other hand need to update the labels as it adds transitions to
